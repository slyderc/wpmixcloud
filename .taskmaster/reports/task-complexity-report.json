			"taskTitle": "Implement Mixcloud-Style Interface with Inline Players and Smart Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a Mixcloud-style interface into detailed subtasks covering: HTML structure for list layout, CSS styling, inline player toggle functionality, player embedding, filter UI components, filter logic with API integration, AJAX-based content filtering, and accessibility/UX enhancements. For each subtask, include specific technical requirements, dependencies, and testing criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex frontend and backend integration with multiple interactive components. It requires significant UI/UX redesign, JavaScript functionality for player management, AJAX-based filtering, and API integration. The task already has 8 well-defined subtasks covering all major components. The complexity is high (8/10) due to the need for seamless user experience, performance optimization with multiple media players, and ensuring accessibility across all interactive elements."
